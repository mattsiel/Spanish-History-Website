# Spanish History Website

## Bio
This website is a passion project that hopes to have a detailed outline of the history of the Iberian Penisula from 1100 to 1300 AD. 

The application uses Vue.js for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database. The easiest way to run it would be to build it in docker using the dockerfile.
